**About our agent**
We've developed an agent that utilizes heuristic search similar to A*, the heuristic function 
changes according to a decision tree containing 4 modes: reatrea,atack,atack_capsule and defense.
Depending on wich agent you are the behavior changes, one being more defensive than the other. 

The heuristic function we've used are not guaranteed to be admissible or consistant as they try to adapt to other conditions rather than estimating the cost of a fix action.
